# Project 3 - CorinthiansBliss

## Description

This is the final project submitted in compliance with the requirements of General Assembly (Sydney) to graduate from the Web Development Immersive. For this project, I chose to make a dating website.

## Features

CorinthiansBliss is a dating website where users have to register to have access to other users' profiles. The website has a search function where users can search for dates by selecting their preferred attributes of their potential dates. Once a user has found a search result, he or she can send a message to the other user and likewise receive a reply, if any. The website utilized the following applications to achieve a functional and clean website:

* Ruby on Rails - wireframe upon which the website is built
* [Bootstrap](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) - responsible for creating a clean and presentable website
* [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/) - responsible for storing all the images saved in CorinthiansBliss
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - where CorinthiansBliss is deployed


## Result
Here is [our live site](https:https://corinthiansbliss.herokuapp.com/)

## Lessons Learned

* The improvement of a website is a continuing process. No matter how perfect the website appears, there will always be changes that need to be made if users are not satisfied with it.

* Planning is essential to making websites. Therefore it helps when developers know what needs to be done and what features can go later.


## Wish List

The website would have provided better user experience if the following features were incorporated which would have allowed users to:

* Send messages to the other user in the same message history.
* Let users see only the names of the other users once in the messages tab to avoid repetition.


## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank Luke Hammer, Matthew Edge-Williiams and Jack Wolf for helping me develop the website and correcting and improving the codes I had. Many thanks also to Lingxiao Wang and Weijia Li for fixing the bugs in the codes.
