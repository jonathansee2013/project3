# Project 3 - CorinthiansBliss

## Description

Developing websites involves working in groups where its members have different ideas, tasks delegated, and versions of have to be controlled and reconciled when using the GitHub. The purpose of the project is to make and develop a website in a group.

## Features

PikQ is a website developed to allow users to take pictures from their webcams. These pictures can be edited and posted to their profiles which in turn appear in the gallery. Users can also comment on and "Like" posts from other users.

The group utilized the following applications to achieve a functional yet visually appealing website:

Ruby
* Ruby on Rails - wireframe upon which the website is built


CSS Framework
* [Bootstrap](https://semantic-ui.com/) - responsible for creating a clean and presentable website
* [Coolors](http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/) - responsible for the purple gradient background appearing throughout the website

Cloud Platforms
* [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/) - responsible for storing all the images saved in PikQ
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - where PikQ is deployed


## Result
Here is [our live site](https:https://corinthiansbliss.herokuapp.com/)

## Lessons Learned

* The most useful important learned in working in groups is that conflicts will inevitably arise so resolving these quickly saves time which can be devoted to completing tasks.

* Planning from the beginning by listing and delegating tasks helps keep the team on track. In our group, we used [teambition](https://www.teambition.com/) to keep track of the tasks progress and share resources useful to accomplish the tasks.

* Never be afraid to explore other applications to give the website the best user experience.


## Wish List

The website would have provided better user experience if the following features were incorporated which would have allowed users to:

* Crop and resize the uploaded image
* Upload stickers they wish to add and choose fonts for the text editor
* Comment on other user's comments using the nested commenting system
* Add tags
* Use search function
